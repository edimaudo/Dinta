Cost benefit analysis scenario

I own a small marketing agency with 15 employees. We currently operate from a rented office space where everyone works full-time onsite. Over the past year, several team members have requested the option to work from home. At the same time, rising rent and overhead costs are putting pressure on my budget.
I am considering moving to a hybrid model where employees work remotely three days a week and come into the office two days a week. This would allow me to move to a smaller, less expensive office. However, I am uncertain whether the savings from downsizing will truly outweigh any potential downsides such as reduced coordination, communication issues, or impacts on productivity.
I need to decide if switching to a hybrid model makes financial sense for my business.
